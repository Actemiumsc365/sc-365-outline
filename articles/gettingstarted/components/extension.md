## Introduction to the SupplyChain365 Extension
With the help of the SupplyChain365 extension, Business Central can be expanded with additional functionalities.
## Extension setup data
The SupplyChain365 extension provides a function with which setup data (no transaction data) can be loaded so that the system is immediately ready for use.
## Extension demo data
The SupplyChain365 extension provides a function with which a set of SkyNet demo data can be automatically loaded to start direct WMS and TMS demonstration transactions.
## Role center
The Supplychain365 extension provides a specific role in Business Central to have an overview of all the most important processes.
## Link Business Central to portal
To use the Supplychain365 extension correctly, it is important to link Business Central to the portal. This can be done through this functionality.
## License plates (nested)
It is possible to use nested license plates. So it is possible to easily add and remove combined goods to a pallet with a new license plate coupled.
## Warehouse agent
With the warehouse agent it is possible to block document or document line. When one employee is active in the app with the document no other user can open that document or document line.
## Session list
In the extension there is a view to show all active app sessions in the environment.
