<p>In the SupplyChain365 Portal, click on admin, then licenses.</p>
<ol>
<li>Here we see two different kinds of licenses: First. SupplyChain365 licenses, and second, external licenses. For example, the license for Microsoft Business Central users.</li>
<li>SupplyChain365 provides licenses for the various modules: Warehouse, Transport &amp; Delivery, Collaborate &amp; Exchange, Third Party Logistics and Value Added Logistics and Scheduler.</li>
<li>For example, we want to buy a warehouse server license and warehouse device licenses for 5 workers.</li>
<li>Simply click on admin, then licenses and select warehouse.</li>
<li>Here we see Warehouse &amp; Logistics Extension and Server. We activate it for 25 to 49 users, which costs â‚¬500 per month.</li>
<li>Below we see Warehouse &amp; Logistics Device. Here we select 5 and click on the checkout button. Then click &quot;I accept the general terms and licensing terms&quot; and then the checkout button to complete the order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: This is a minimum price, actual prices can be higher based on size of your organization.</p>
<p>This license will result in extra monthly costs based on usage of certain resources. See the license description.</p>
<p>Now the order is being processed.</p>
<p>Also, on the External Licenses page a user can buy licenses for essential users, team members, device users and premium users. Simply increase the counter, add to cart and checkout.</p>
