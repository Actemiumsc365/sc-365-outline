<p>How to load Supply Chain 365 demonstration data</p>
<p>We have created a new company by the name of Skynet. As you see there is no data available, so to work with data, we must load demo data. Let's start!</p>
<p>Loading the Skynet demo data:</p>
<p>Go to the Microsoft Edge browser, and login to Business Central.
Switch to the Supply Chain 365 Profile Role Center by using the gear icon and My Settings.
Select the Supply Chain 365 Profile from the Role list and click OK. From the Role Center main menu, go to Setup and select Demo Data. A new screen will appear.
Click the Skynet Demo Data button. The system will ask you whether you are sure you want to insert demo data. Click yes and again yes for confirmation.
It will take a couple of minutes to load all the demo data into the current company. When done, close the screen and refresh the Business Central cues to review the changes.
Well done! Our demo data was loaded successfully. Now, we can use the demo data. Enjoy!</p>
