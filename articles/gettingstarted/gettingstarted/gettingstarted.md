<p>To get started quickly and learn to Operate SupplyChain365, we have created a feature in the SupplyChain365 Extension called &quot;demo-data&quot;. Starting from an empty company, this feature will fill Business Central with the information needed to demonstrate &amp; test most of the capabilities and features of SupplyChain365, For the demo-data we use an imaginary company called SkyNet. From the movie picture Terminator featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger. SkyNet is a manufacturer and whole seller of Drones. The demo-data contains customers, vendors, items, orders, locations, employees etc. But more importantly, the demo data is completely configured so that all the features and capabilities are ready to go. This way you do not have to spend time configuring the system before you can use the APP to proces a picking order with a mobile device for example. With every update of the Extension the demo-data will be updated as well to demo and test specific scenarios or new features that have been added.</p>
<p>We recommend using a Sandbox Environment with a blank (production setup data only) Company, when you want to get started and learn SupplyChain365 . Installing the SupplyChain365 Extension into a company in a Sandbox environment will not influence any production systems or databases.</p>
