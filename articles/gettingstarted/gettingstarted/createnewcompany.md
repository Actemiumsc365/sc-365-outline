<p>What is a company?</p>
<p>Think of a company as a container that holds information about a legal entity.</p>
<p>How to add a new company to Business Central:</p>
<p>A new company can be added in the company list page. You can reach this page by clicking the search button or pressing Alt + Q and typing 'companies' in the search bar. From the search results, select ‘Companies’.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the company list page, we are going to make a new company. Click ‘New’, and then ‘Create new company’.</li>
<li>Click Next, and then enter the company name. Note: To create a new company, you must be assigned the SUPER permission set.</li>
<li>Click Next and choose Production - Setup Data Only.</li>
<li>Click Next, and then click Finish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: when you create a new company, it takes a few minutes before you can access it in Business Central. The Setup Status on the company page indicates whether the new company is ready yet. If so, you can switch to the new company in My Settings menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the gear icon menu and select My Settings and then Company. Choose the Skynet Corporation and click OK, and then OK again.</li>
<li>You are now in the Skynet Corporation company, and it is ready for use. Note: once a company is created, you can't change its name, but you can change its display name.</li>
</ul>
