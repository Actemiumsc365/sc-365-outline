<p>This article is about adding label printers to the Supplychain365 Portal</p>
<p>A label printer is a computerized device that prints on self-adhesive label sheets and label material. It is typically designed to be connected to a computer that has the necessary software to make up the label prints. Label printers are used in a wide range of applications, including logistics, retail, healthcare and warehousing.</p>
<p>How to add a printer to the SupplyChain365 Portal:</p>
<p>Click on components. Then click on printers to add a new printer. Here we have no printer at all. Let's click new and fill in the form: name, IP Address, port number, brand, model, description, and, if necessary, serial number. Then click save. A new printer has been added to the SupplyChain365 Portal and is ready to be used.
Here you see a list of all the printers with complete information about the device, like name, IP address, port number, and brand. If you want to add a new printer, just click the new button with the plus icon.
Here you can edit a printer's details, e.g. if you want to change the IP address or assign a new port number.
In order to delete a printer, simply click delete.</p>
<p>It is important that your device can connect the printer by IP and port directly in the network infrastructure.</p>
