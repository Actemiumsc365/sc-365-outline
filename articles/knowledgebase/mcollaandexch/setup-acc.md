* Once you click the given link you will be redirected to a login page
* Click on sign in with a Microsoft account and yes now you see the accept invite button and a message: “You are invited to collaborate via the SUPPLYCHAIN365 Partner Portal. Please click the button below to accept the invitation.”
* Accept the invitation and now you can collaborate and exchange information and business data.
