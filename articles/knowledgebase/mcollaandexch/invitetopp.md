**how to invite a partner to the partner portal**

With the module collaboration and exchange it is possible to work digitally with your supply chain partners.

The partner portal of supplychain365 provides customers, vendors, and 3PL customers visibility into the status of orders and inventory positions.

Let clients and customers enter or upload their orders through your supplychain365 portal.

Customer: a customer can see all the company details like, purchase orders, Warehouse receipt, purchase return orders, purchase invoices, and purchase credit memos.

Vendor: a vendor can see information about company details like, sales orders, Warehouse shipments, sales return orders, sales invoices, and sales credit memos.

3PL Customer: a 3PL customer can see information about company details like shipments, deliveries, and stock information. For the stock information, they can see the items' license plates and locations.

Note: using this module requires you to have a Collaborate and Exchange Server license for a user license per partner contact.

Via the supplychain365 portal, it is possible to activate and adjust these licenses.
