All the steps are similar to part one of recording a license plate but first, you have to toggle on some settings in the supplychain365 extension on Business Central.   
Open Business Central, click on the warehouse and logistic navigation menu, and click on the location on the navigation bar.   
Select corebox, and scroll down until you find the supplychain365 mobile settings fast tab.   
On receive settings, toggle on enable license plate recording, after enabling this option other options will be available, and you would toggle on require scanning of a license plate and scan license plate after pressing the stop recording options.   
We need these options to record a license plate on an internal identifier. The difference from part one is that you can scan or set an internal identifier and that is visible on business central.   
Note: You can choose all options if you think you need them.
