# How to register defects and add photos in the logistic process

**What is a product defect**

 A product defect is any characteristic of a product that hinders its usability for the purpose for which it was designed and manufactured. product defects arise most prominently in legal contexts regarding product safety.

***How to report a defect in the mobile application with a photo.***

Log in to the Supply Chain 3 65 mobile application and click on any process, where you have seen a defect.

For example, I have seen a defect during the put away process, in an item,

click on the put away and select one of the receipt orders.

In the upper right corner of the mobile application, you see a**kebab menu**. Click on it and select Report defect.

we are in bin receive 1, so we select our item from this bin.

Here we scan the item with the scanner or simply click on the item,

on the report defect page Select how much of the item is bad or not working. You can also select a reason.

**The reasons are:**

***External defect:*** damage caused by external action. (selected as example)

***Internal defect:***damage caused by internal action.

***Color:*** deviation in color or color does not match.

Click confirm, select lot number and quantity again and click done.

Now a photo screen appears.

If all steps were good, click new, take photos and click confirm.

Now a damage report on that specific item has been saved.

Once you click on that specific item you will find out that the item has been reported as damaged. Here you can make a new damage report if you want.

**Recording a new damage report**

if you see another defect in this item you can click new to make a new report on same item,

the process is simple and it is the same as you record a defect.

This is how to add a new damage report to an item with an existing damage report.
