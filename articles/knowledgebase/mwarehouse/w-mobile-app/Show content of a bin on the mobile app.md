# Show content of a bin on the mobile app

In this video we introduce the hamburger menu in the SupplyChain365 mobile application.

* Click on hamburger menu and select, Bin Contents. A bin is the smallest unit of space where your items are stored.
* Here you can scan a bin and see its content or availability. Also you can enter number manually for example SHIP01.
* You can see the list of items on this bin in location CORE BOX and zone. Lets scan the code, this is the ship 01 barcode.
* *Swiping right an item*, you can navigate to the item details. Click on the triangle icon in order to see all the item details like item number, description, variant, identifier etc.
* Click on print to print the above information on a label through a zebra label printer.
* *By swiping left*, you see an item tracking icon that shows item tracking. Swipe and click on it to see the item tracking information.
* If you scan a bin without items, it shows “empty bin”. For example: bin RECEIVE-01 is an empty. When you scan it, you will see a message that the bin is empty.
* If we scan a barcode and see this message bin not found it means that we have no bin, or the bin has been deleted.
