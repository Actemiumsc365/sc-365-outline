# How to Receive a Large Number of License Plate

**How to receive a large number of license plate**

This is very important when you receive articles or items in a larger amount inside a license plate or pallets, so we need an automatic technique to do this job. In supplychain365 we need to activate a few settings and the job is done.

So, let’s start the process step by step:

Open Business Central click on the search button and type purchase order to create a purchase order, from the purchase order create a warehouse receipt.

Click here for a full tutorial about creating purchase orders and warehouse receipts.

**Creating purchase order**

Complete the form and add items or articles then click on Create warehouse receipt.

On the warehouse receipt page click on supplychain365 on the right side of the mobile setting to activate these buttons.

1. Enable license plate recording: when you toggle this button on you see some other buttons are available.
2. And toggle on automatically start license plate recording that is newly available after activating the first button.

That was on supplychain365 in Business Central now I show you the rest in the supplychain365 mobile application.

Open the supplychain365 mobile application and in the warehouse main menu click on receipt process.

The first line is the newly created receipt so open it. After clicking on it you will see a popup message box with a close button and the license plate recording is started as you see in the application.

Go further and select all lines after selecting them stop the license plate recording.

The license plate is recorded, and you can see the license plate information in Business Central by searching for license plates.

This is what it looks like after recording and these are the items inside the license plate.
