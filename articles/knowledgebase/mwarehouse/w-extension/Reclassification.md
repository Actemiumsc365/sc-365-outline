This permission allows the warehouse worker to quickly move stock between bins and locations (for example, from HARDBOX to MIDBOX).

**Reclassification in the app**  
after activating the setting then you see a button in the movement process order screen that allows the warehouse user to reclassify items, but only for moving them from one bin to another.  
This button has to be enabled for the warehouse group.  
This function enables warehouse users to transfer stock between bins and locations. The user enters the normal flow for creating new movements. instead of only being able to choose bins to place from the same location, the user can now select any bin from any non-directed location. If the user scans a bin that is present in more than one location, a pop-up appears, allowing the user to select the desired location.

**Add license plate to item reclassification journal in extension (SC365)**  
there is a license plate field in item journal lines. These fields are specifically for Reclassification.  
There is now also a button to add a license plate to Reclassification, this uses the same license plate selection screen as is uses in the rest of the extension, it is filtered on all Locations that do not use Directed put-away and pick.  
The extension will now also handle license plates correctly in reclassification from the APP.
