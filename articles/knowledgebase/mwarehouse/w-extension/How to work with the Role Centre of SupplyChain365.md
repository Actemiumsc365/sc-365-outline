# How to work with the Role Centre of SupplyChain365

**Role Centre of SupplyChain365**

The Role Centre is the user's entry point and home page for SupplyChain365. You can develop several different Role Centres, where each Role Centre is customized to the profile of the intended users. We have 4 different roles in SupplyChain365:

* **SupplyChain365 – Manager**
* **SupplyChain365 – Warehouse & Logistics**
* **SupplyChain365 – 3PL & VAL**
* **SupplyChain365 – Transport & logistics**

**How to set up:**

* Go to Business Central. In the upper right corner of the screen, you can see the**gear icon** (⚙️), where you will find My Settings.
* At the top of the pop-up window, you will see Role, which indicates the role of the current user. For example: KAREL has the role of manager in SupplyChain365.
* Click on the **kebab menu** (***three dots***) on right side of the Role field to change the current user's role or see other roles.

**General information**

Here the general information about the roll center:

* At the top of the page, we have the application bar.
* On the left side, we can see the application name and on the right side you see a company icon which you can click if you easily want to select a different company. Next to the company icon we can find the search button, which allows you to search through Business Central.
* Notification indicates whether there are any notifications.
* Next, we find the Setup, which we can use to design a page, inspect a page, and change my Settings. Next, you will find the Help button, which will help you with all aspects of Business Central (*SupplyChain365*). The last Icon indicates the current user, which you can use to sign out from SupplyChain365.
* Just below the application bar we find the Navigation Menu. Click on it to see the Navigation bar.
* The area below it is called the Headline.
* It displays business data which has been selected as the most relevant.
* On the right-hand side there is a list of actions.
* The list of actions gives you quick access to certain tasks.
* We then have several Activity Queues.
* The Activity queues can be divided into data queues, which display aggregated business data, and action queues, that link to a task or an operation.

All these queues, the navigation menu and the navigation bar will be dependent on which role centre we have chosen. This is the Manager Role Centre, so the information that is displayed here will be relevant for a manager.
