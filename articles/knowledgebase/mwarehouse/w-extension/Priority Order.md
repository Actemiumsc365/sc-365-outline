# Priority Order

**Priority Order**

**What is priority order?**

If an order has priority, it is the most important order you have to do or deal with or must be done or dealt with before everything else you have to do.

In this way, it is possible to give priority to specific picks because, for example, they need to be delivered today.

In SupplyChain365 there is a priority option for sales orders, picking, and warehouse shipment.

The steps to set priority to an order and show it to warehouse employees are:

1. Open **Business Central** click on warehouse and logistics and select sales order.
2. In the sales order page click on Create New Sales Order and select Plus button wait until the sales order page appears.
3. **Complete the sales order** page customer name, contact and other details then click on priority order or toggle on the priority button.
4. I**n the lines fast tab select item**, no, description, location, and quantity this is enough information to create a priority order.
5. **Release the document** and you will see that the document status changed to released.
6. Click on Create Warehouse Shipment.
7. In the warehouse shipment page control the information if everything is good then toggle on priority order, release the document, and click on create pick.
8. Once the pick document is created then this order will be counted as an important order.
9. Once you completed all the above steps then you will be able to see this order as a prioritized order on the mobile screen.
10. To see prioritized orders in the mobile application, go to your mobile device open the supplychaine365 app, and log in with your credentials. once you log in click on the pick process and here you see all orders but orders with exclamation marks at the top of the orders are with priority.

This is how to create an important order with priority in Business Central.
