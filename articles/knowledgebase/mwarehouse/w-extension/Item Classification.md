# Item Classification

**Item Classification**

With the help of an analysis, it is possible to divide the items into different classes. We often talk about the ABC analysis here.

ABC analysis is quite useful for the organization as it leads to:

**1. Optimization of ABC Inventory Management function**

**2. Avoiding loss of business opportunities**

**3. Less stock handling costs for low-value items**

**4. Opportunity to convert Class B items into Class A**

 Your **A items** are the ones that cost the most and are used the most, for example, raw materials that are used every day in production processes.

Your **B items** are those that cost less and are used less frequently, for example, office supplies that don’t need constant replenishment but are expensive enough that they should still be always stocked.

Your **C items** are those that cost the least and are used even less frequently,for example, spare parts for machines whose regular maintenance will keep them running without any issues for years without needing replacement parts.

**ABC analysis** classifies inventory into 3 categories:

Class A – forms 15% to 20% of the stock quantity but commands 80% to 85% of the total inventory value. Class A items should be managed very closely.

Class B – forms 30% to 35% of the stock quantity but commands 10% to 15% of the inventory value. Class B items are the items that a business should closely monitor.

Class C – forms 50% of the stock in terms of quantity but commands only 55% of the inventory value. Class C items are very low-value items that are not in high demand with the customers.

Item classification in Business Central

There are two ways to classify the items in Business Central:

1. **First:**by opening an existing item and changing the item classification code.
2. **Second:** create a new item and set the item classification code.

**First method:**

Open Business Central and click on the search button then type items and click the related link.

Wait until the item card page loads now we are on the item cards page here we have many items.

Last month I sold hawx 7X very much now I am going to classify this item to class A.

Click on hawx 7X item once you see the item card page click on item classification then set the item in class A.

This is how to change item classification.

**Second method:**

In this scenario you notice in market the an item has more demand in the whole market so you import or

Open Business Central and click on the search button then type items and click the related link.

Wait until the items card page loads, now we are on the item cards page here click on the plus or new button to create a new item card.

Wait until the new item card page appears then fill in the item card necessary fields click on item classification and set the item class to A, B, or C as raw material is very important, so I put the item in Class A.

Here I click to import a picture for the item for better identification of an item then close the item card and the card is created.

Here is our created item in the items page.

These were the common way for item classification.
