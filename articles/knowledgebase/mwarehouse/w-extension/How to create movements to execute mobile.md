# How to create movements to execute mobile

**What is movement in a warehouse?**

Goods Movements within the Warehouse. For every goods movement in WMS (warehouse management system), you move materials from one storage type to another based on a transfer order. You record all material information that is relevant for goods movements in the transfer order. A transfer order is a document that is used to execute the movement of goods from one warehouse location to another or the movement of goods between one storage unit and another within the warehouse.

Here all the steps to create a movement:

* Go to Business Central and select the role of Supplychain365 manager. Click on search and type movement worksheet or select from the warehouse and logistic navigation menu and click movement worksheet.
* Fill in the fields on the worksheet lines manually, or use Get Bin Content to automatically fill in the lines:
  + Insert a line of items to create movement.
  + select item number > A00881
  + Description > The Hummingbird
  + from zone code> supplychain365 storge
  + from bin code > B – 01-02
  + to zone code > Supplychain365 Crossdocking
  + to bin code> Crossdocking
  + Quantity > 5
* Above information is enough to create movement. So, click on create movement document.
* Lift warehouse source document options to default but you can change it and click ok. Pop-up message box with a message of movement activity number MAGVR has been created. Click ok and this movement is now available in the mobile application to be executed.
* Enter lines in the movement worksheet, create a warehouse movement document, move the items, and register the warehouse movement.
* In the movement worksheets, you would enter lines for the items that you want to move. From the movement worksheet, you can create a warehouse movement document that instructs the user to move the items. When the items are moved, the warehouse movement is registered.
