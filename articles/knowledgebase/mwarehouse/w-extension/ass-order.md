# Assembly Order

**Assembly Order**

Companies can supply products to customers by combining components without using manufacturing features. features for assembling items integrate with related features such as sales, planning, reservations, and warehousing. An assembly item is a sellable item that contains an assembly bill of material. Business Central lets you supply assembly items in the following ways:

1. assemble to order
2. assemble to stock

**Assemble to order**

Use the assemble-to-order process for items that you don't want to stock. for example, for the following reasons:

* you'll customize the items for customer requirements.
* you want to minimize the cost of on-hand inventory.

**Assemble to stock**

use the assemble-to-stock process for items that you assemble and store for future sales. assemble-to-stock items are standard items, such as packaged kits, that you don't customize. you can also consume these items as subassembly components. the items are picked and processed as single items and are treated as finished production items. 

**The process to assemble items for order or stock is as follows:**

* go to business central
* search for items by pressing the (alt + q) shortcut and open the related link.
* click on the replenishment fast tab under the item card page.
* on the right side you see assembly policy and here you can choose between assemble to stock and assemble to order.
