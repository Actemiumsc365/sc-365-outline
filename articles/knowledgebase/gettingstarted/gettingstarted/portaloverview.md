<p>The SupplyChain365 portal is a gateway between users, components and the logistics system.</p>
<p>This is how to log in to the SupplyChain365 Portal. First go to <a href="https://portal.supplychain365.net">https://portal.supplychain365.net</a>.</p>
<p>Then click log in to enter the main page of the SupplyChain365 Portal.</p>
<p>Note: the SupplyChain365 Portal works with your companyâ€™s registered email address.</p>
<p>Here we see a number of different menus. Letâ€™s look at them one by one. On the right side, there is the SupplyChain365 logo. By clicking it you see the current user and the sign out button. Next to the SupplyChain365 logo, you see the language menu where you can choose between different languages.</p>
<p>With the buttons on the left side, you can navigate to all the important pages, such as the home page that displays which organization is currently using the SupplyChain365 Portal.</p>
<p>The components menu consists of different options like labels, printers, devices and more.
The admin menu consists of administration and management options regarding different aspects of the SupplyChain365 Portal.
The last one is the help button, with which you can navigate to the support portal, where you will find information about the Supplychain365 Portal. In upcoming videos we will jump deeper into each of these menus.</p>
