## Introduction to SkyNet

**SkyNet** is a specialized company in the drone industry. They assemble drones and sell ready-made drones purchased from suppliers. Additionally, they maintain an extensive inventory of drone-related items that they produce, assemble, purchase, and sell.

### Business Model

SkyNet operates with a dual focus:

- **Direct Sales**: Selling as many products as possible from stock to end customers and retail stores
- **Logistics Excellence**: Maintaining precise stock administration through regular inventory counts and corrections
- **Fleet Operations**: Operating their own fleet of trucks for supplier pickups and customer deliveries
- **3PL Services**: Providing warehousing and logistics for third parties (webshops and traders without their own infrastructure)

### Strategic Challenge

> **"SkyNet wants to introduce a new system to support their supply chain execution"**

Due to the rapid pace of innovation in the drone market, SkyNet must avoid being stuck with outdated inventory. Their focus on supply chain execution encompasses:

- Production
- Distribution
- Storage
- Fulfillment
- Transport

This end-to-end approach ensures control over the flow of goods from procurement to last-mile delivery.
