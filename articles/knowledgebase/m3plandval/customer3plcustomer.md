# What is the difference between a customer and 3PL customer

Logistics is the overall process of managing how resources are acquired, stored, and transported to their destination. A company that provides 3PL services provides logistics services for other parties, for example, transport or warehouse storage (Skynet).

* A customer is an individual or business that purchases another company's goods or services. Customers are important because they drive revenues.
* A 3PL customer is a customer for which the company arranges logistics. In the customer card, you can set whether a customer is a 3PL customer or not, and you can determine the values of the 3PL activities (pick, put-away, storage, etc.).

For a 3PL customer the inventory is stored, picked, packed, and shipped by a third-party company. See in Business Central:

* login to Business Central
* Click on the search icon type ‘customers’ and select the customers list.
* in the customer list page on the left side, you see a column ‘Is 3PL customer’.
* if it’s checked then this customer is 3PL if not checked then this customer is not a 3PL customer.

> **Note:** Refer to the How to Create 3PL client instruction if you wish to add or create a 3PL client.

**Business Central standard option to record own stock**

If you buy your own stock, stock with a value will be placed in the warehouse and will disappear again when it is released

We also call this 1PL, where PL stands for Party Logistics. There are service providers who can take over the logistics operations for a company. 3PL or Third Party Logistics consists of outsourcing a large part or even the entire logistics process of a company to an external logistics operator. The 3PL acts as an intermediary between the client and its customers, organizing transport activities and storage facilities.Supplychain365 makes this possible in Business Central. The work in the logistics process is then carried out and these can also be charged to the 3PL client per activity. In this way, goods can be centrally stored in large quantities and sent separately to customers at the request of the 3PL client.
