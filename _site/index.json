    "summary": "/* This creates a general setup for THIS page only */ p, li { text-align: justify; } How to create a sandbox environment What's an environment? Companies in Business Central online exist in what are referred to as environments. There are two types of environments: Production and Sandbox. In short, production environments contain live business data, and sandbox environments are used as a safe place to test things like new business processes or features. If you have access to a company, you have access to the environment it's in. If you have access to more than one company, and those companies are in different environments, when you sign in to Business Central you must specify the environment that you want to work in. Environments are particular to a given area, so if your organization works in multiple countries or regions, you need separate environments for each one. If you have access to a company, you have access to the environment it's in. How to create a sandbox environment Make sure your account has the 'Dynamics 365 Administrator' role set for your tenant. Follow the next steps: Go to Microsoft 365 Administration Center > Users and check your usersâ€™ role assignments. Go to your Microsoft Edge browser, and login to the Dynamics 365 Business Central admin center. In Business Central you can find the admin center under the gear icon button (âš™ï¸\u008F). In the Admin center, go to Environments and review the list of your current Business Central environments. Create a new Environment by clicking on the + in the menu. Name your new environment (e.g. SupplyChain365-demo-test), select 'Sandbox' as the type, choose your country and choose the latest version of Business Central. When finished, click 'Create'. It will take a couple of minutes for your new Environment to be created. Go to the company in your newly created Sandbox by clicking the URL: https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/ / In a new Sandbox, you get 2 companies by default. CRONUS (Microsoft's demo company) and an empty My Company. Databases are protected by automatic backups that are kept for 28 days. The backup includes data from any production and sandbox environments in the database. Below a video to understand the steps visually:"

    "summary": "/* This creates a general setup for THIS page only */ p, li { text-align: justify; } Getting started with SupplyChain365 To get started quickly and learn to Operate SupplyChain365, we have created a feature in the SupplyChain365 Extension called \"demo-data\". Starting from an empty company, this feature will fill Business Central with the information needed to demonstrate & test most of the capabilities and features of SupplyChain365, For the demo-data we use an imaginary company called SkyNet. From the movie picture Terminator featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger. SkyNet is a manufacturer and whole seller of Drones. The demo-data contains customers, vendors, items, orders, locations, employees etc. But more importantly, the demo data is completely configured so that all the features and capabilities are ready to go. This way you do not have to spend time configuring the system before you can use the APP to proces a picking order with a mobile device for example. With every update of the Extension the demo-data will be updated as well to demo and test specific scenarios or new features that have been added. We recommend using a Sandbox Environment with a blank (production setup data only) Company, when you want to get started and learn SupplyChain365 . Installing the SupplyChain365 Extension into a company in a Sandbox environment will not influence any production systems or databases.

    "summary": "/* This creates a general setup for THIS page only */ p, li { text-align: justify; } How to add label printer layouts to SupplyChain365 What is a label? The most important functions of labels are to describe the product, its usage, cautions in use, and specify its contents. Identification of the product or brand are other important functions performed by labels. In the video below we will show you how to add, edit and delete labels. To create your own labels you need to take the next steps: To add labels click on the component menu, select labels and then click on the new button to create a label. Select a name for the label, for example: Receipt Header or Receipt line. In SupplyChain365 we have various processes like: inventory count header, inventory count line, item, license plate header, receipt header, receipt line. All of these processes have their own properties. In the receipt header process, we have many properties: Number, Location Code, Bin Code, Posting Date, and more. In the receipt line process, we have the following item properties. Source document, source number, item number, description and more. These are the item properties that can be seen on the label and that can be printed. ZPL Code (Zebra Programming Language) ZPL is the language used by all ZPL compatible printers. It is a command based language that is used by the printers as instructions to create the images on the labels. Here I have the codes for the Receipt header process and the Receipt line process. To add the code, you have to make sure it is active. If it is not active, then the label will not be printed. You can make more than one label per process. When itâ€™s finished, in the preview you can see all the information on the label which comes from different processes. Save the label so you can print it later. Note: In part 2 of the video, we will see that it is possible to create a label just by using Zebra Designer software, without any knowledge of coding. It is so easy. Just try it. We are going to create a label for the receipt header process and one for the receipt line process. How to edit and delete labels. Letâ€™s look at a label. Here we can edit a label, for example the receipt header label Click edit and change â€˜Posting Dateâ€™ to â€˜Assign Dateâ€™. Preview it and see how it has changed. When you're finished, save the current changes. You can simply delete a label by clicking the delete button. The item will be deleted permanently. How to create a label with the help of software (without coding). This is in part 2 of the videos below. We use Zebra Designer to create labels and edit labels. Here are the steps: Go to www.zebra.com and select Support and Downloads, then Printer and click on Software Support. Here you find everything available for printers, such as designing barcode labels or cards, drivers, developer tools, device management and security. Here we select designing barcode labels and from the drop down menu go down and click on Zebra Designer. There is a lot of information about the Zebra Designer software. If you want to use this software with extra features, you must download the latest Zebra Designer with license. For now, we use the free version of Zebra Designer. Scroll down till you find the zebra designer installer file with .exe extension. Download and install it. The steps to install are so easy. Just follow the on-screen instructions. Create Label for Receipt Header process and Receipt Line process. In this last video below we will show you how to make a label for the Receipt Header process and a label for the Receipt line process. The steps are really simple. Just follow the on-screen instructions. In the video below we are using Zebra Designer. It's very easy and efficient. Note: Anyone without knowledge of Z P L coding can use this software. This area is called the header, the Receipt header. We will first make a label for this process. This area is called the line, the receipt line. We will also make a label for this process. Let's start the Zebra software and see how labels are made. Part1: Below a video to understand the steps visually:"
